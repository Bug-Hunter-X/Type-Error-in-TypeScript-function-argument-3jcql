# Type Error in TypeScript function argument
This repository contains a simple example of a type error that can occur in TypeScript when passing an array to a function that expects a single string argument.  The `bug.ts` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix it.

The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's expected argument type and the actual argument provided.  Understanding this type of error is crucial for writing robust and reliable TypeScript code.
